**The team is now working on [the WordPress Interactivity API](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/03/04/interactivity-api-dev-note/). This unblocks the same UX Frontity framework enabled but directly in WordPress Core, fully compatible with the new Site Editor.**

# ¬ª Welcome to Frontity

**üëã** Hi! Welcome to the Frontity documentation.

The Frontity documentation is distributed across three separate sites:

* [**docs.frontity.org**](https://docs.frontity.org) - Introduction, concepts and guides
* [**api.frontity.org**](https://api.frontity.org) - API Reference
* [**tutorial.frontity.org**](https://tutorial.frontity.org) - Step-by-step guide

This site \(docs.frontity.org\) is where you will find all the information you need to start building something awesome with Frontity.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you're new to Frontity check out the [step-by-step tutorial](https://tutorial.frontity.org/). It's the quickest way to get up to speed with Frontity.
{% endhint %}

Let's kick things off by providing you with a roadmap so that you can find your way around the documentation and zero in on the information you need right now.

## [Quick Start](getting-started/README.md)

If you're new to Frontity then you can get started by heading over to, erm..., the [**Getting Started**](getting-started/) section.

This is where you'll find the [**Quick Start Guide**](getting-started/quick-start-guide.md) that will get you up and running with Frontity quickly.

Once you've followed the Quick Start Guide and have a working Frontity installation you may want to continue learning by creating a more elaborated project with the [**step-by-step guide**](https://tutorial.frontity.org/).

## [About Frontity](about/README.md)

To learn about what Frontity is, how it works, and what features it has, visit the [**About Frontity**](about/) section.

If you're a **developer** this section will tell you all about what Frontity is capable of and what you can do with it.

If you're a **project manager** or other **decision maker** that needs to choose or justify whether to use Frontity for your project then this section provides the information you need.

## [Core Concepts](learning-frontity/README.md)

This section is the heart of the Frontity documentation. Once you've nailed the basics in the Getting Started section you should head over to the [**Core Concepts**](learning-frontity/) section to really dig in to the detail and learn how to work with Frontity.

## [Architecture](architecture/README.md)

Find out about how the relationship between Frontity and WordPress is structured in the [**Architecture**](architecture.md) section, where you will also learn about possible hosting solutions.

## [Deployment](deployment/README.md)

Once you've completed the development of your project and have a working application that you're happy with you can learn how to deploy to live in the [**Deployment**](deployment/) section.

In particular we go into detail on how to [**deploy to Vercel**](deployment/deploy-using-vercel.md), our recommended hosting platform. Why do we recommend it? Because it's serverless, cheap, includes a CDN, and is really easy to set up.

## [Isomorphic React](isomorphic-react.md)

Frontity sites are [Isomorphic React](isomorphic-react.md) apps which are executed both on the server-side and on the client-side. In this section you'll learn how the isomorphic approach works in Frontity and how you can customize your site accordingly.

## [Performance](performance/README.md)

With a good [caching strategy](performance/caching.md) your Frontity project can be as performant as a static site. 

Also, applying mechanisms such as [Link prefetching](performance/link-prefetching.md) is highly recommended to improve the perceived performance.

## [SEO](seo.md)

By default, Frontity will deliver to your browser a fully populated and well-formed HTML file generated from your React code that ensures a good SEO score.

But it also allows you to optimize the SEO performance of your site and customize how your site is indexed by search engine crawlers through the use of [Header meta tags](seo.md#header-meta-tags) and [`robots.txt`](seo.md#robots-txt). 

## [Guides](guides/README.md)

This is where you'll find an ever-growing series of [**Guides**](guides/). Some will help you in working with Frontity. Others will give you ideas for projects and provide you with the help you need to guide you from first steps to fully working project.

This is where you can really have fun with Frontity and work toward your stretch goals.

In this section we also provide you with some foundational knowledge that will assist you when working with Frontity. So if you need a refresher, or if you're new to the topics, we have included introductions to [JavaScript/ES6](guides/javascript-basics.md) and [React](guides/react-basic.md) in this section.

The [troubleshooting guide](guides/troubleshooting.md) is also here, for when you encounter problems. If your problem is not solved here then don't forget that you can also ask the community in the [**Frontity Community Forum**](https://community.frontity.org).

## [Contributing](contributing/README.md)

Frontity is an open source project and welcomes contributions in all forms. The [**Contributing**](contributing/) section of the documentation will guide you whether you want to make a single contribution or whether you intend to become a fully fledged contributor to the Frontity project.

We also encourage you to join the [Community Forum](https://community.frontity.org) to share your projects and ideas with fellow users and community members. This is the best place to build new connections and get community support.

Oh, and if you haven't already, you can show your support by starring the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/frontity/frontity).
