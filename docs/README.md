{% endhint %}

Let's kick things off by providing you with a roadmap so that you can find your way around the documentation and zero in on the information you need right now.

## **Quick Start**

If you're new to Frontity then you can get started by heading over to, erm..., the [**Getting Started**](getting-started/) section.

This is where you'll find the [**Quick Start Guide**](getting-started/quick-start-guide.md) that will get you up and running with Frontity quickly.

Once you've followed the Quick Start Guide and have a working Frontity installation you may want to continue learning by creating a more elaborated project with the [**step-by-step guide**](https://tutorial.frontity.org/).

## **About Frontity**

To learn about what Frontity is, how it works, and what features it has, visit the [**About Frontity**](about/) section.

If you're a **developer** this section will tell you all about what Frontity is capable of and what you can do with it.

If you're a **project manager** or other **decision maker** that needs to choose or justify whether to use Frontity for your project then this section provides the information you need.

## **Core Concepts**

This section is the heart of the Frontity documentation. Once you've nailed the basics in the Getting Started section you should head over to the [**Core Concepts**](learning-frontity/) section to really dig in to the detail and learn how to work with Frontity.

## **Architecture**

Find out about how the relationship between Frontity and WordPress is structured in the [**Architecture**](architecture.md) section, where you will also learn about possible hosting solutions.

## **Deployment**

Once you've completed the development of your project and have a working application that you're happy with you can learn how to deploy to live in the [**Deployment**](deployment/) section.

In particular we go into detail on how to [**deploy to Vercel**](deployment/deploy-using-vercel.md), our recommended hosting platform. Why do we recommend it? Because it's serverless, cheap, includes a CDN, and is really easy to set up.

## **Guides**

This is where you'll find an ever-growing series of [**Guides**](guides/). Some will help you in working with Frontity. Others will give you ideas for projects and provide you with the help you need to guide you from first steps to fully working project.

This is where you can really have fun with Frontity and work toward your stretch goals.

In this section we also provide you with some foundational knowledge that will assist you when working with Frontity. So if you need a refresher, or if you're new to the topics, we have included introductions to [JavaScript/ES6](guides/javascript-basics.md) and [React](guides/react-basic.md) in this section.

The [troubleshooting guide](guides/troubleshooting.md) is also here, for when you encounter problems. If your problem is not solved here then don't forget that you can also ask the community in the [**Frontity Community Forum**](https://community.frontity.org).

## **Contributing**

Frontity is an open source project and welcomes contributions in all forms. The [**Contributing**](contributing/) section of the documentation will guide you whether you want to make a single contribution or whether you intend to become a fully fledged contributor to the Frontity project.

We also encourage you to join the [Community Forum](https://community.frontity.org) to share your projects and ideas with fellow users and community members. This is the best place to build new connections and get community support.

Oh, and if you haven't already, you can show your support by starring the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/frontity/frontity).
