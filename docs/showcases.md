# 🎤 Showcases

Want to see what the community is building with Frontity? Here are some great examples of Frontity in action!

{% hint style="info" %}
If you have created a Frontity site, whether for a client or as a personal project, you can help us and the rest of the community by sharing it. Sharing your project in our [**Showcases section**](https://community.frontity.org/c/showcases/19) means that others can learn, get inspired and see what can be accomplished with Frontity. An example is worth a thousand words. 🙂
##How to add your site
There are several different ways to add your Frontity site to the Showcase page:
1. Online form
2. Community forum
3. GitHub
###Online form
The easiest way is to fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe1yNVt-CP6zbGzfltIIu3Vj5eLFAjHpd_6qaZOuVpGUurh4g/viewform) with your site’s information:
- Title of your site (required)
- URL of your site (required)
- Source code (e.g. the GitHub repo of the project)
- Testimonial (a few lines about your experience with Frontity)
- Your email address (in case we need to contact you if there’s a problem with your form)
That’s it! We will review your submission and feature your project in the Showcase page.
###Community forum
In order to add it to the forum, simply go to the [Showcase category](https://community.frontity.org/c/showcases/19), open a new topic, and write a post with a link to your site. Here are [some ideas](https://community.frontity.org/t/about-the-showcases-category/43) to include in your forum post. All the sites shared in this category are featured in the Showcases page too.
###GitHub
If you prefer to use GitHub instead, go to the [Showcase page](https://docs.frontity.org/showcases) and click the “Edit on GitHub” link (on the right sidebar). This will take you directly to the Showcases file in the repository.

Edit the `showcases.md` file and add your submission with the following format:

```
## Title of your Site

* Site: https://yourfrontitysite.com
* [Source code](https://github.com/user/github-repo)

> This can be a brief description of your site and/or your feedback about Frontity.
```

If there’s no open source code, feel free to remove that text line. Once finished, click the “Propose file change” button and create a pull request. We will review your pull request and merge it with the final version if everything is fine. For a more detailed explanation on how to edit a documentation file on our gitbook-docs repo, please check out [this guide](https://github.com/frontity/gitbook-docs/wiki/Edit-on-Github).

> Using Frontity has been a pleasure. It’s really awesome how easily you can create a custom theme for Frontity, and integrate all the WordPress data on it. And, as it’s a React app, the possibilities are unlimited, I’m already thinking to add some extra-features with business-logic to my blog. Using WordPress as a headless CMS and having an isolated React App to develop the frontend is the best scenario to achieve that.

> It’s essentially built off the mars-theme, with my own custom styling added and some of the structure rearranged. I’m still new to React and I’m primarily a designer \(though I call myself a “design technologist” to hint at that\), but I think there’s some nice stuff about it.

> It’s kind of crazy how quickly I was able to do this knowing nothing about Frontity and not being super advanced with React. It was a 2.5 week dev timeline, and the mouse elements in particular were challenging to do, not due to Frontity but mostly due to lack of familiarity with doing advanced React stuff.
