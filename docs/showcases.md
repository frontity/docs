> For our new Frontity.org site did a stress test of Frontity + Gutenberg. All layouts were created using built-in blocks. The header and the footer are template parts. For the about page, we reused the same blocks, so no extra code/styles were needed \(and it looks awesome\). [Read more](https://twitter.com/luisherranz/status/1258757519654227968?s=20).

> I applied Frontity on a HTML5 up template and used react-transition-group to orchestrate the animations. It's a simple site but in my opinion it was a great way to get started with Frontity. I might do another one as it was pretty fun to make.[Read more](https://community.frontity.org/t/html5-up-dimension-template-for-frontity-matnard-dimension-theme/2123).

> Using Frontity has been a pleasure. It’s really awesome how easily you can create a custom theme for Frontity, and integrate all the WordPress data on it. And, as it’s a React app, the possibilities are unlimited, I’m already thinking to add some extra-features with business-logic to my blog. Using WordPress as a headless CMS and having an isolated React App to develop the frontend is the best scenario to achieve that.

> It’s essentially built off the mars-theme, with my own custom styling added and some of the structure rearranged. I’m still new to React and I’m primarily a designer \(though I call myself a “design technologist” to hint at that\), but I think there’s some nice stuff about it.

> Frontity is really exciting! I was looking around for a scalable solution for a WordPress based news portal project. Doing some search on Google took me to the Frontity website. I started exploring the architecture and found it something similar to what I had in my mind, having separation of concerns - frontend and backend api. Having myself working as a developer and having experience with React, I really liked the idea and decided to give it a try. As the news portal project was moved to later this year, I thought to build a personal blog on tech to learn about the framework. With some help from the community, I could successfully setup to run Frontity as a microservice on AWS and running the backend cms on another EC2 instance. I even configured backend to work with AWS Opsworks, there by able to horizontally scale the same time. It was easy to setup and had to tweak just the frontity templates for the frontend. I'm still to explore whole range of possibilities Frontity provides for my upcoming news portal project.

> It’s kind of crazy how quickly I was able to do this knowing nothing about Frontity and not being super advanced with React. It was a 2.5 week dev timeline, and the mouse elements in particular were challenging to do, not due to Frontity but mostly due to lack of familiarity with doing advanced React stuff.
