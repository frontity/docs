# Showcases

Want to see what the community is building with Frontity? Here you have some examples!

{% hint style="info" %}
If you have created a Frontity site, for a client or just your personal site, help us by sharing it in this [**Showcases section**](https://community.frontity.org/c/showcases/19) so others can learn, get inspired and see what can be accomplished with Frontity. Sometimes, an example is worth a thousand words. :slight_smile:

> Using Frontity has been a pleasure. It’s really awesome how easily you can create a custom theme for Frontity, and integrate all the WordPress data on it. And, as it’s a React app, the possibilities are unlimited, I’m already thinking to add some extra-features with business-logic to my blog. Using WordPress as a headless CMS and having an isolated React App to develop the frontend is the best scenario to achieve that.

> It’s essentially built off the mars-theme, with my own custom styling added and some of the structure rearranged. I’m still new to React and I’m primarily a designer (though I call myself a “design technologist” to hint at that), but I think there’s some nice stuff about it.

> My first Frontity project (though plenty of Frankensteining different components from Mars and TwentyTwenty). Just wanted to share it here though it's in a very early version - just super pumped to have a somewhat workable version. [Read more](https://community.frontity.org/t/first-frontity-jobby/1102).

> It’s kind of crazy how quickly I was able to do this knowing nothing about Frontity and not being super advanced with React. It was a 2.5 week dev timeline, and the mouse elements in particular were challenging to do, not due to Frontity but mostly due to lack of familiarity with doing advanced React stuff.
