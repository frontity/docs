# Embedded Mode

In **Embedded Mode** the _primary domain points to the WordPress server_. This is the URL that visitors access directly in order to view the content.

WordPress (via the [Frontity Embedded Mode plugin ](https://api.frontity.org/frontity-plugins/embedded-mode)) will redirect the request to Frontity, which will get the data from the REST API to return the final HTML as an [Isomorphic](https://medium.com/capital-one-tech/why-everyone-is-talking-about-isomorphic-universal-javascript-and-why-it-matters-38c07c87905) React App that will be returned to the user by WordPress.

{% hint style="warning" %}
This mode requires the installation, activation and configuration of the [Frontity embedded mode plugin](https://api.frontity.org/frontity-plugins/embedded-mode) to work.
{% endhint %}

Any [Frontity architecture requires 2 servers](README.md). In Embedded Mode you need to have:

- A **main domain** pointing to the **WordPress Server**, either:
  - An Apache or Nginx web server running PHP
  - A hosted software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform with WordPress such as WordPress.com (only plans allowing plugin installation)

- A **secondary URL** (or subdomain) pointing to the **Frontity Server**, either:
  - A server running Node.js
  - A hosted function-as-a-service (FaaS) platform allowing serverless computing such as AWS Lambda or Netlify functions

In this mode _both site visitors and content editors use the same domain_, i.e. the main domain, to either visit the site or access the WordPress admin pages. The Frontity server on the secondary domain is never directly accessed.

Embedded mode requires the [Frontity Embedded Mode plugin](https://api.frontity.org/frontity-plugins/embedded-mode). This plugin replaces the WordPress theme with its own template file which fetches the HTML from the Frontity server. However, before Frontity can deliver the HTML it must request the content from the WordPress REST API, necessitating a two stage round trip.

Due to the "two stage round trip", **caching is therefore a necessity** in this architecture to ensure that site performance is optimal.

### Features of the Embedded Mode

Embedded Mode offers several **advantages** over Decoupled Mode.

- The WordPress site exists under the primary domain, thus ensuring that:
  - all the _SEO benefits_ already built-in to WordPress work as normal
  - _existing SEO_ (for a site transitioning to Frontity) will not be affected
  - _sitemaps_ generated by WordPress/Yoast/All-in-one-SEO work as normal
  - _WordPress page cache plugins and hosting CDNs_ continue to work as normal
- Content producers/editors continue to have the same experience
  - _post/page preview_ remains available
  - the _admin bar_ is active for logged in users

In addition, since the Frontity site is never directly accessed the secondary domain can be anything - including free domains allocated by the node.js hosting service - so there is no need to purchase an additional domain or configure DNS settings for sub-domains.

{% hint style="info" %}
In this mode, a [serverless](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/serverless/) solution to host the Frontity server is especially recommended as it will make it cheap, easy and infinitely scalable.
{% endhint %}

But there are some _things that should be taken into account_ when using Embedded Mode:

- It requires an additional plugin, namely the [Frontity embedded mode plugin](https://api.frontity.org/frontity-plugins/embedded-mode).
- It will not work with free wordpress.com plans as the installation of a plugin is required.
- WordPress still needs to go through it's [bootstrap process](https://wordpress.tv/2017/06/22/alain-schlesser-demystifying-the-wordpress-bootstrap-process/) on initial page load
- More routing is involved (resulting in potentially slower execution than Decoupled Mode) with the "two stage round trip" (WordPress → Frontity → WP REST API → Frontity → WordPress), so **a caching strategy is a necessity** rather than simply a nice to have.

#### Technical considerations

Due to the one-domain nature of this mode and the fact that the routing is managed by WordPress, _developers don’t need to take care of any of the issues mentioned on the [Decoupled Mode](./decoupled-mode.md)_ page, including:
  - URL replacements
  - Cross-domain 301 redirections
  - CORS headers
  - Purge page cache
  - Proxy WordPress resources from the Frontity server
  - WordPress posts 301 redirections
  - Maintain the reverse proxy configuration

These are all either unnecessary (in the case of URL replacements), or continue to be handled by WordPress.

In this mode content editors continue to have the same editing experience, just like in the Reverse-Proxy mode:

- The admin bar is visible for logged in users.
- Post previews continue to work just as in a normal (non-headless) WordPress installation.


## Caching in Embedded Mode

In **Embedded Mode** the main domain is connected to the WordPress server which will use a custom template (provided by the plugin) to redirect to the Frontity Web Server in order to get the proper HTML based on the data of the WP REST API.

![](https://frontity.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/embedded-mode-features-cache.png)

In this model the following cache layers are **highly recommended**:
- [CDN for caching URL requests made to WordPress](../performance/caching#cdn-for-wordpress-servers)
- [Local caching for URL requests in WordPress servers](../performance/caching#local-caching-for-url-requests-in-wordpress-servers)
- [Local caching for REST API requests in WordPress servers](../performance/caching#local-caching-for-rest-api-requests-in-wordpress-servers)


{% hint style="warning" %}
As there is more routing involved in Embedded Mode (WordPress makes a call to Frontity, which makes a request to the WP REST API, which then returns the JSON to Frontity, and which then returns the HTML to WordPress) _a caching plugin for the HTML (caching the URL requests) is a necessity_ rather than simply a nice to have.
