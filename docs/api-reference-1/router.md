# @frontity/tiny-router

## Installation

Add the `tiny-router` package to your project:

```text
npm i @frontity/tiny-router
```

And include it in your `frontity.settings.js` file:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  packages: [
    "@frontity/mars-theme",
    "@frontity/wp-source",
    "@frontity/tiny-router",
  ],
};
```

## Settings

#### state.router.autoFetch

When `autoFetch` is activated, tiny-router does a `actions.source.fetch(link)` each time the action `actions.router.set(link)` is triggered. This ensures that the data you need for the current page is always available.

It also does a `actions.source.fetch(link)` in the `beforeSSR` action to ensure that the data needed for SSR is also available.

It's `true` by default.

## How to use

### State

Tiny router has the following state:

#### state.router.link

This is the path the site is in. For example, `/category/nature/`.

These are some examples of links:

* `/`: You are in the home, path is `/` and page is `1`.
* `/page/2`: You are in the page 2 of the home, path is `/` and page is `2`.
* `/category/nature:` You are in the category `nature`, path is `/` and page is `1`.
* `/category/nature/page/2`: You are in page 2 of category `nature`, path is `/` and page is `2`.
* `/some-post`: You are a post, path is `/some-post`.
* `/some-page`: You are in a page, path is `/some-page`.

#### state.router.state

This is the object that was saved in [`window.history.state`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History/state) when the route was changed.

### Actions

#### actions.router.set

Tiny Router is very simple, it only has one action: `actions.router.set` .

**Parameters**

* **link** `string`
  * The URL that will replace the current one.
  * It doesn't matter if it's just a path like `/category/nature/`, a path that includes the page `/category/nature/page/2` or the full URL `https://site.com/category/nature`.
  * _`link` is short for permalink_.
* **options** `object` \(optional\)

  An optional object that can contain:

  * **method** `"push" | "replace"` \(default: `"push"`\)

    The method used in the action. `"push"` corresponds to [`window.history.pushState`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History/pushState) and `"replace"` to [`window.history.replaceState`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History/replaceState)

  * **state** `object`

    An object that will be saved in `window.history.state`. This object is recovered when the user go back and forward using the browser buttons.

**TypeScript**

```typescript
actions.router.set = async (link: string, options: {
  method: "push" | "replace",
  state: object
}): Promise<void>;
```

**Examples**

This is a very simple, but functional `Link` component created with `actions.router.set`:

```javascript
const Link = ({ actions, children, link }) => {
  const onClick = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    actions.router.set(link);
  };

  return (
    <a href={link} onClick={onClick}>
      {children}
    </a>
  );
};
```
